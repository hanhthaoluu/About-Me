    <h1>Welcome to Thao's About Me Page</h1>
    <p class="page-content" id="opening statement">Hello there! My name is Hanh-Thao Luu (Thao).  I am currently living in Seattle and <br />
      seeking a position as a Software Developer.</p>
    <p class="page-content" id="education">I graduated from the University of Washington <br />
      with a BS in Microbiology and a BA in Psychology. I worked in the healthcare industry for about six years <br />
      before discovering my great interest in software development. <br />
      CodeFellows has provided me the excellent supports and education to be an exceptional developer.</p>
    <p class="page-content" id="personality">I am a self-motivated, persistent and diligent person. <br />
      I don't take "no" as an answer. I like to think creatively to make the impossible possible. <br />
      I like to explore the unknown and to push the limits. <br />
      My goals in life are to be an excellent software developer, <br />
      a loving mother of two kids, and a responsible citizen contributing to make life better <br />
      for the humankind and to preserve Earth.</p>
