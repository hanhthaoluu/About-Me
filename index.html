    <p class="page-content" id="favorite places">Ten top outdoor activities to do in the Greater Seattle Area</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hike Mount Rainier - Paradise in July to see the colorful field of wild flowers. See if you can spot deers and foxes while you are there.</li>
        <li>Stroll along the Alki Beach for the glorious sunset.  The view of the downtown Seattle skyline is unbeatable from Alki. During the summer months, take the water taxi from the Alki Beach to downtown Seattle. At Alki, if you look close enough, you can spot some seals, sea otters and even owls.</li>
        <li>View the breathtaking view of the Puget Sound up high from the Carkeek Park Play Area and then walk down to the beach. During the lowest tides you can admire starfish, sea cucumbers, sea anemones, crabs, and other sea creatures.</li>
        <li>Take a walk at the Washington Park Arborerum in May along the glowing Azeleas and Rhododendron trails.</li>
        <li>Go to the Olympic Farm Game to visit all the exotic animals and feed the goats.</li>
        <li>When it's 90s degrees in Seattle, go to the Lake Crescent, near the Canadian border, and don't forget to stop by the Sol Duc Hotspring. Lake Crescent is the most beautiful and crystal clear lake in the NW.</li>
        <li>In the summer, take the gondola up to the Crystal Mountain. Looking out from the gondola on your way up to the Crystal Mountain is the most transquil and unforgetable experience ever.</li>
        <li>In April, see the cherry blossoms at the UW Quad. Remember to track the blooms with Cherry Blossoms Live Stream so you don't miss the moment.</li>
        <li>During the month of April, Tulips Festival is a must. Pictures don't do it justice! Remember to take an earlier exit, Exit 225 (I believe) instead of Exit 226 and take the back roads from there so you are not stuck in line for one hour.</li>
        <li>Visit Flower World, fifteen acres of nursery/animal farm/garden center, to find exotic plants and feed the chickens,sheeps and goats. Bring your camera for the peacock dances.</li>
